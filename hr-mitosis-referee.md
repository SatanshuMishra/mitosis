## Goal

Run 2 of the harness-redesign program (~/.mitosis/harness-redesign/PROGRAM.md, thread harness-redesign in the pipeline repository): make mitosis enforce referee exclusion, gate teeth, full finding reporting, bounded subprocess calls, usage-limit parking and K6 outcome entries, shipped as ready pull requests through the full lane under overrides O1 to O10.

## Done when

- [ ] c1 M1 Referee exclusion: the charter's `- Locked:` paths plus referee globs (test configuration, baselines, allowlists, snapshots, skip lists) can never be in a write-set: `--plan-only` refuses an items file whose write-set includes one, and reconcile reports a Worker write to one as fatal and reverts it.
- [ ] c2 M2 Gate teeth: an acceptance test passes the gate only when it fails without the work and passes with it, and is not skipped: the broken-add fixture (a test that only checks a symbol exists) and a skipped test each fail the gate; an inert test fails the gate and holds the MSP back from shipping.
- [ ] c3 M3 The JSON result lists every finding of every MSP and the exit code is the most severe: a run with an inconclusive gate in MSP 1 and an undeclared write in MSP 2 reports both.
- [ ] c4 M4 Every git call and test run has a time limit: an AST test fails on any subprocess call without `timeout`; a hanging pre-commit hook ends with a named error.
- [ ] c5 M5 A Worker that stops at a usage limit is parked, not failed, and `--resume` re-dispatches only parked and failed Lanes: a stub Worker printing a usage-limit line leaves its Lane `parked-limit`, and a resume skips every `ok` Lane.
- [ ] c6 M6 After every gate, one K6 outcome entry per acceptance test is appended to the trajectory store passed with `--trajectory`.

## Where things stand

Stage 3 review round 3 at b9e309b (MSP mitosis/hr-mitosis-referee over base 5a94f41); the locked files are unchanged there (same receipt-lock). Rounds 1 (c98552d) and 2 (b95181f) both ended `loop`; every confirmed blocker and advisory of both is fixed with a receipt, and C4 of round 2 needed no change (restore already batched, 8 or 9 git calls at any size). Rejected and outside-class items for the final report: round 1 C4 and S6 (decision 4), S3 and S7 (repeats), S8 (unreachable); round 2 C2 (vendored phpunit.xml holds the MSP by decision), S1 (repeat), S4 (glob pathspecs in revert_implementation, older than the fix pass). Round 3's diff and both reviewer briefs are written in review/round-3; the suite runs on 3.15 and 3.9 into review/round-3/hr-mitosis-referee.suite.txt. The checkout holds this run's uncommitted glossary section and ADRs 0006 to 0008, which ship only with the MSP.

## Next step

When the advisory fix agent reports, check its commits, then start review round 3 at the new head: locked-file check, diff and suite in review/round-3, code-reviewer and security-reviewer with previous_head b95181f, earlier findings the round-1 and round-2 records, diagnoses the two round-2 diagnosis.json files.

Needs: D1, R1, R2.

## Decisions in force

- D1 Interphase hand-off: build the handed-off spec as one MSP of seven Steps: Hand off now: one MSP, seven ordered Steps, criteria 5.1 to 5.6 as M1 to M6 and 5.7 for docs and version 0.8.0, built from feat/hr-mitosis-referee cut from main 1391d39 after the O2 check author locks the acceptance tests.

## Open risks

- R1 The paused step-commits-render-fields run (branch mitosis/step-commits-render-fields, round 1 diagnose, feature feat/step-commits-render-fields) changes run.py, mitosis.py and core.py too; this run cuts from main, so whichever merges second resolves the conflicts.
- R2 The owner's checkout holds an uncommitted GLOSSARY.md edit and untracked docs/adr/0004 and 0005 from step-commits-render-fields; this run builds from committed main and never touches them.
- R3 The installed mitosis 0.7.0 composes its own pull-request title and body, while the owner's hook accepts only what `pull-request render` prints; at ship, a refused title or body is taken from `pull-request render`, never edited by hand.

## Settled, do not reopen
