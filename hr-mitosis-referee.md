## Goal

Run 2 of the harness-redesign program (~/.mitosis/harness-redesign/PROGRAM.md, thread harness-redesign in the pipeline repository): make mitosis enforce referee exclusion, gate teeth, full finding reporting, bounded subprocess calls, usage-limit parking and K6 outcome entries, shipped as ready pull requests through the full lane under overrides O1 to O10.

## Done when

- [ ] c1 M1 Referee exclusion: the charter's `- Locked:` paths plus referee globs (test configuration, baselines, allowlists, snapshots, skip lists) can never be in a write-set: `--plan-only` refuses an items file whose write-set includes one, and reconcile reports a Worker write to one as fatal and reverts it.
- [ ] c2 M2 Gate teeth: an acceptance test passes the gate only when it fails without the work and passes with it, and is not skipped: the broken-add fixture (a test that only checks a symbol exists) and a skipped test each fail the gate; an inert test fails the gate and holds the MSP back from shipping.
- [ ] c3 M3 The JSON result lists every finding of every MSP and the exit code is the most severe: a run with an inconclusive gate in MSP 1 and an undeclared write in MSP 2 reports both.
- [ ] c4 M4 Every git call and test run has a time limit: an AST test fails on any subprocess call without `timeout`; a hanging pre-commit hook ends with a named error.
- [ ] c5 M5 A Worker that stops at a usage limit is parked, not failed, and `--resume` re-dispatches only parked and failed Lanes: a stub Worker printing a usage-limit line leaves its Lane `parked-limit`, and a resume skips every `ok` Lane.
- [ ] c6 M6 After every gate, one K6 outcome entry per acceptance test is appended to the trajectory store passed with `--trajectory`.

## Where things stand

Interphase Phase 9: spec, record and items written and passing check_spec, check_record --complete and check_items; one MSP, seven ordered Steps, criteria 5.1 to 5.6 are M1 to M6 and 5.7 is docs and version 0.8.0. The spec reviewer is running. Glossary section "Referee and gate" is appended to the checkout's GLOSSARY.md and ADRs 0006 to 0008 are written; the run home holds worker-rules.txt (with O3's line) and dispatch.zsh.

## Next step

Apply the spec reviewer's fixes (also drop tests/fixtures/g14-cases.json from gate-teeth's files), rerender and recheck, then hand off: tree guard verify, record status handed-off.

## Decisions in force

## Open risks

- R1 The paused step-commits-render-fields run (branch mitosis/step-commits-render-fields, round 1 diagnose, feature feat/step-commits-render-fields) changes run.py, mitosis.py and core.py too; this run cuts from main, so whichever merges second resolves the conflicts.
- R2 The owner's checkout holds an uncommitted GLOSSARY.md edit and untracked docs/adr/0004 and 0005 from step-commits-render-fields; this run builds from committed main and never touches them.

## Settled, do not reopen

## Where the details live

- Program: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/PROGRAM.md (run 2 of harness-redesign; intent I1 to I6, contracts K1 to K7, overrides O1 to O10)
- Contracts: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/contracts/ (k1-acceptance, k2-locked, k3-check-result, k6-outcome)
- Audit: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/audit/mitosis.md
- Run home: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/mitosis/hr-mitosis-referee
- Run directory: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/runs/mitosis/hr-mitosis-referee
- Spec, decisions, record and items: /Users/satanshumishra/Documents/DevLabs/mitosis/docs/specs/hr-mitosis-referee.{md,decisions.md,record.json,items.json}
